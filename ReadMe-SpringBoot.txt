Step 1: Download project from Git hub.

Step 2: Import the project to any IDE.

Step 3: Add any of the local server(I have used tomcat server 9.0).

Step 4: Run the class 'EmployeeApp' which contains main() methid from the project.
(Once the server gets startd, we can do calls to the spring boot project through API's.)

Step 5: Use this 'http://localhost:8080/employees' URL to check is the server started or not(If its ask for the credentials,use this credentials,
Username: vikram and Password: 12345678)
